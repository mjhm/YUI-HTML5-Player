	_Note: For illustrative purposes all available options were used in the example above._
	
	- __contentBox__: A &lt;div&gt; in which you'd like to place the player
	- __type__: This will always be 'video' until audio support is added
	- __sources__: A list of paths to source files and their MIME-Types. This is used to provide videos in various codecs in order to hit all platforms (e.g. Theora, MPEG-4, etc.).
	- __poster__: A path to a placeholder image file that is shown will the video is being downloaded
	- __autoplay__: [true|false] Whether or not the video should autoplay.
	- __loop__: [true|false] Whether or not the video should loop.
	- __standardControls__: [true|false] Whether or not the player should create its own controls or use the browser controls.
	- __controlSet__: An array of controls that should be available when using non-browser controls. __Availble controls are__:
		- _play_: Play/Pause button
		- _rewind_: Rewind button 
		- _forward_: Fast Forward button
		- _fullscreen_: Fullscreen button
		- _volume_: Volume Slider
		- _scrubber_: Scrubber Slider
	- __width__: An integer representing the desire width of player in pixels. The video will be letter-boxed to preserve its aspect ratio.
	- __height__: An integer representing the desire width of player in pixels. The video will be letter-boxed to preserve its aspect ratio.
	- __degrade__: Content to be shown in browser that do not support &lt;video&gt;.
3. Be sure you have any empty div in your DOM with an ID matching what you put in contentBox

		<div id="video"></div>
